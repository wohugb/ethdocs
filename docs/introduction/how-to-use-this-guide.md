This section captures the basic ways in which a user would want to
participate in the Ethereum project. First of all, to become a node in
the network, you need to run an Ethereum client. Multiple
implementations are listed in the section [sec:clients]{role="ref"}
which also gives you advice as to which clients to choose in various
setups. [sec:connecting-to-the-network]{role="ref"} gives you basic
information about networks, connectivity troubleshooting and blockchain
