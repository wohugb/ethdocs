The Ethereum Foundation {#foundation}
=======================

The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization registered in
Switzerland, and has the purpose of managing the funds that were raised
from the ether Sale in order to best serve the Ethereum and
decentralized technology ecosystem.

Founded July 2014 in Switzerland, Stiftung Ethereum's mission is the
promotion of developments of new technologies and applications,
especially in the fields of new open and decentralized software
architectures.

It is the aim that decentralized and open technologies will be
developed, nurtured, promoted and maintained. A dominating, but not
exclusive, focus is set on the promotion of the development of the
Ethereum Protocol and the relevant technology to it as well as the
promotion and support of applications using the Ethereum technology or
protocol. Stiftung Ethereum will additionally support and advocate for a
decentralized Internet in a variety of forms.
