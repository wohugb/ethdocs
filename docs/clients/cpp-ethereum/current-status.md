==============

We blog about the codebase periodically on the [Official Ethereum
blog](https://blog.ethereum.org) and elsewhere. Here are some recent
articles from the development team:

    plan](https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/07/12/c-re-licensing-plan/)
    (July 2016)

We [simplified the project
naming](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/250) at
Homestead (March 2016), although some naming shadows of the past still
linger. With the homecoming we have another name to retire -
**webthree-umbrella**.

At the time of writing (August 2016), we are just completing our
\"Homecoming\", where the code has been reconsolidated into the
[ethereum/cpp-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum)
repository. From October 2015 until August 2016 it was split across
multiple repositories under
[ethereum/webthree-umbrella](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella)

The re-licensing plan is the culmination of a very long-term plan to
[liberalize the core](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Licensing).
An effort was begun in 2015 to re-license the cpp-ethereum core as MIT,
but it was never completed.

This is a revival of that effort, especially with a view towards the
potential for collaboration with the [Linux
Foundation](http://linuxfoundation.org)\'s
[Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org) project, and with other
corporations outside of Hyperledger who wish to build Ethereum
private/consortium chain solutions similar to
[HydraChain](https://github.com/HydraChain/hydrachain). The [Rubix by
Deloitte](http://rubixbydeloitte.com/) project is an example of that
approach.
