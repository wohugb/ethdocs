Linux ARM cross-builds for mobile, wearables, SBCs
==================================================

[Bob Summerwill](http://bobsummerwill.com), of [doublethinkco](http://doublethink.co) cross-builds [ARM binaries](https://github.com/doublethinkco/webthree-umbrella-cross/releases) which work on a very broad variety of hardware, from mobile and wearables Linux distros (Sailfish OS, Tizen OS, Ubuntu Touch) to the same SBCs which [EthEmbedded](http://ethembedded.com) target - and more. doublethinkco was a [BlockGrantX recipient](http://doublethink.co/2016/02/23/we-have-blockgrantx-funding/) in Feb 2016.

See the [cpp-ethereum-cross README](https://github.com/doublethinkco/cpp-ethereum-cross) for a full matrix of platforms and known status.

Here are the cross-build binaries from doublethinkco: [RELEASED -- Cross-build eth binaries for Homestead](http://doublethink.co/2016/03/07/released-cross-build-eth-binaries-for-homestead/).
