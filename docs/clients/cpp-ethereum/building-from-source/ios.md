Building for iOS
================

We don\'t currently have a working iOS build, though that is [on the
roadmap](https://github.com/doublethinkco/webthree-umbrella-cross/issues/36)
for [doublethinkco](http://doublethink.co). iOS is a UNIX-like operating
system based on Darwin (BSD) using ARM chips. This is a [different
API](http://doublethink.co/2015/12/31/a-tale-of-two-abis/) than the ARM
Linux cross-builds, meaning that specific binaries will be required.
