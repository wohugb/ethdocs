encourage their use. Since each byte of the address is represented

sent to it will be lost forever. The possibility to kill a contract
has to be implemented by the contract creator him/herself using the

Homestead will launch when block 1,150,000 is reached on the
Mainnet. On the Testnet, Homestead will launch at block 494,000.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>metropolis</summary><p>The third stage of Ethereum\'s release. This is the stage when the</p><p>user interfaces come out (e.g. Mist), including a dapp store, and
non-technical users should feel comfortable joining at this point.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>serenity</summary><p>The fourth stage of Ethereum\'s release. This is when things are</p><p>going to get fancy    the network is going to change its mining
process from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>frontier</summary><p>Ethereum was planned to be released in four major steps with</p><p>Frontier being the name for the first phase. The Frontier release
went live on July 30th, 2015. The command line Frontier phase was
mainly meant to get mining operations going with the full reward of
5 ether per block and also to promote the emergence of ether
exchanges. Frontier surpassed earlier modest expectations and has
nurtured tremendous growth of the ecosystem.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>olympic</summary><p>The Frontier pre-release, which launched on May 9th 2015. It was</p><p>meant for developers to help test the limits of the Ethereum
blockchain.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>morden</summary><p>Morden is the first Ethereum alternative testnet. It is expected to</p><p>continue throughout the Frontier and Homestead era.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>testnet</summary><p>A mirror network of the production Ethereum network that is meant
for testing. See Morden.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>private chain</summary><p>A fully private blockchain is a blockchain where write permissions</p><p>are kept centralized to one organization.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>consortium chain</summary><p>A blockchain where the consensus process is controlled by a</p><p>pre-selected set of nodes.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>micropayment</summary><p>A micropayment is a financial transaction involving a very small sum</p><p>of money (\&lt;1 USD) and usually one that occurs online.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>sharding</summary><p>The splitting of the space of possible accounts (contracts are</p><p>accounts too) into subspaces, for example, based on first digits of
their numerical addresses. This allows for contract executions to be
executed within \'shards\' instead of network wide, allowing for
faster transactions and greater scalability.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>hash</summary><p>A cryptographic function which takes an input (or \'message\') and</p><p>returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string, which is called the hash
value (sometimes called a message digest, a digital fingerprint, a
digest or a checksum). A hash function (or hash algorithm) is a
process by which a document (i.e. a piece of data or file) is
processed into a small piece of data (usually 32 bytes) which looks
completely random, and from which no meaningful data can be
recovered about the document, but which has the important property
that the result of hashing one particular document is always the
same. Additionally, it is crucially important that it is
computationally infeasible to find two documents that have the same
hash. Generally, changing even one letter in a document will
completely randomize the hash; for example, the SHA3 hash of
\"Saturday\" is
c38bbc8e93c09f6ed3fe39b5135da91ad1a99d397ef16948606cdcbd14929f9d,
whereas the SHA3 hash of \"Caturday\" is
b4013c0eed56d5a0b448b02ec1d10dd18c1b3832068fbbdc65b98fa9b14b6dbf.
Hashes are usually used as a way of creating a globally agreed-upon
identifier for a particular document that cannot be forged.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>crypto-fuel</summary><p>Similar to \'gas\', referring to the amount of cryptocurrency

prefix encoding (RLP), described in the [RLP section of the
wiki](<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP</a>).</p></details><details class="info"><summary>double spend</summary><p>A deliberate blockchain fork, where a user with a large amount of</p><p>mining power sends a transaction to purchase some produce, then
after receiving the product creates another transaction sending the
same coins to themselves. The attacker then creates a block, at the
same level as the block containing the original transaction but
containing the second transaction instead, and starts mining on the
fork. If the attacker has more than 50% of all mining power, the
double spend is guaranteed to succeed eventually at any block depth.
Below 50%, there is some probability of success, but it is usually
only substantial at a depth up to about 2-5; for this reason, most
cryptocurrency exchanges, gambling sites and financial services wait
until six blocks have been produced (\"six confirmations\") before
accepting a payment.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>SPV client</summary><p>A client that downloads only a small part of the blockchain,</p><p>allowing users of low-power or low-storage hardware like smartphones
and laptops to maintain almost the same guarantee of security by
sometimes selectively downloading small parts of the state without
needing to spend megabytes of bandwidth and gigabytes of storage on
full blockchain validation and maintenance. See light client.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>uncle</summary><p>Uncles are blockchain blocks found by a miner, when a different</p><p>miner has already found another block for the corresponding place in
the blockchain. They are called \"stale blocks\". The parent of an
Uncle is an ancestor of the inserting block, located at the tip of
the blockchain. In contrast to the Bitcoin network, Ethereum rewards
stale blocks as well in order to avoid to penalize miners with a bad
connection to the network. This is less critical in the Bitcoin
network, because the Block Time there is much higher (\~10 minutes)
than on the Ethereum network (aimed to \~15 seconds).</p></details><details class="info"><summary>GHOST</summary><p>Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree is an alternative chain-selection</p><p>method that is designed to incentivize stale blocks (uncles) as
well, thus reducing the incentive for pool mining. In GHOST, even
the confirmation given by stale blocks to previous blocks are
considered valid, and the miners of the stale blocks are also
rewarded with a mining reward.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>merkle patricia tree</summary><p>Merkle Patricia trees provide a cryptographically authenticated data</p><p>structure that can be used to store all (key, value) bindings. They
are fully deterministic, meaning that a Patricia tree with the same
(key,value) bindings is guaranteed to be exactly the same down to
the last byte and therefore have the same root hash, provide
O(log(n)) efficiency for inserts, lookups and deletes, and are much
easier to understand and code than more complex comparison-based
alternatives like red-black trees.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>DAG</summary><p>DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph. It is a graph, a set of nodes</p><p>and links between nodes, that has very special properties. Ethereum
uses a DAG in Ethash, the Ethereum Proof of Work (POW) algorithm.The
Ethash DAG takes a long time to be generated, which is done by a
Miner node into a cache file for each Epoch. The file data is then
used when a value from this graph is required by the algorithm.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>uncle rate</summary><p>The number of uncles produced per block.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>issuance</summary><p>The minting and granting of new cryptocurrency to a miner who has

The log events are part of the transaction receipt which is produced
when the transaction is executed. The receipts are stored in the
receipt trie, the integrity of which is guaranteed by the fact that
the current root of the receipt trie is part of the block header
alongside the roots of state and state-trie. In a broad sense from
the external perspective receipts are part of the Ethereum system
state except that they are not readable contracts internally.</p></details>
